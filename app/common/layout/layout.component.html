      <h2>Responsive Sidenav Example</h2>
      <p>This example use media queries to transform the sidenav to a top navigation bar when the screen size is 900px or less.</p>
      <p>We have also added a media query for screens that are 400px or less, which will vertically stack and center the navigation links.</p>
      <p>You will learn more about media queries and responsive web design later in our CSS Tutorial.</p>
